## qhvg/win95-keygen

## Usage

```main.py [-cd/-oem] [amount]```

If amount is not provided, script will generate 1 key.

## Note
- A brief explanation of key generation is available in source code (comments)
- [andreazllin's validator](https://windows95keygen.andrealin.it/) detects OEM keys from this script as invalid for some unknown reason. However you still can use them to install Windows 95.
